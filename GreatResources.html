This is a collection of some of the great resources I have come across during my self-directly learning on Machine Learning and Data Science.

<a href='http://research.microsoft.com/apps/vidoe/default.aspx?id=259579'>Zoubin Ghahramani-Probablisti Machine Learning - Foundations and Frontiers</a>

<p>This is a great intro to the current state of Baysean Methods in Machine Learning. Zoubin talks about 5 areas he's excited about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baysian Non-parametrics ( infinite dimensional extension of finite dimensional models)<li>
<li>Probablistic Programming - high level languages to automate model selection and other tasks that are otherwise manual and bespoke</li>
<li>Baysian Optimisation - optimisation under uncertainty using Baysian methods</li>
<li>Probablistic models for efficient data compression</li>
<li>Automated statistician</a>
<li>Baysian allocation of computational resources.</li>
</ul>
